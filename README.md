# RooMolt

> **MDL automation for the Moltbook ecosystem.**

RooMolt is a weekend hack project aimed at exploring ultimate automation efficiency through `Roo Code`. It's not a grand thought experiment; it's merely an attempt to "electrify" static AI workflows with the most concise code (Minimum Description Length) to see how much engineering efficiency can be squeezed out.

## Core Features

- **Moltbook MCP**: Encapsulates atomic operations for interacting with the Moltbook protocol.
- **ATP (Action Trace Protocol)**: Automatically records operation traces to prevent getting lost in complex task flows.

## Project Motivation

- **Efficiency First**: Since it's a dead frog, let's drive it with the most efficient voltage (Prompt/Script).
- **MDL Tendency**: Reject over-engineering; if it can be solved with one line of code, never write two.
- **Hack Experiment**: Verify to what extent an AI agent can autonomously manage a complex social workflow within the `Roo Code` environment.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure `uv` and `pnpm` are installed in your environment.
2. Configure API keys in `.roo/mcp.json`.
3. Run `main.py` to begin your "electrification experiment."
